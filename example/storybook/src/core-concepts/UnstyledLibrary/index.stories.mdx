## Introduction

`@gluestack-ui/themed` is intentionally designed as an unstyled library, providing you with the flexibility to style your components as you prefer.

gluestack-ui provides a collection of unstyled components that can be styled according to a specific theme or design language. These components are reusable, consistent, interactive, and are accessible on the web, iOS, and Android.

## Key Features

- **Unstyled by Default:** All gluestack-ui components are unstyled by default, allowing users to define their own styles or use a styling library. Read more
- **Optional Styling:** Users have the choice to apply custom styles to components, tailoring the appearance to match their project's requirements and design language. [Read more](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/theme/customizing-components)
- **Accessibility:** Components are designed to be functional, and accessible, and follow the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices guidelines, ensuring a seamless user experience. [Read more](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/overview/accessibility)
- **Lightweight:** gluestack-ui is lightweight, promoting better performance and faster load times. [Read more](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/performance/overview)

## Styling Options

The `gluestack-ui` provides multiple flexible styling options to customize the appearance of components according to your preferences.

## Default Components

By default, when you use `@gluestack-ui/themed`, you get plain, unstyled components.

But, it also comes with a package called `@gluestack-ui/config`, which has ready-made styles for all the components. So, you can choose these styles if you like. Please visit [Themed Library](https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/core-concepts/themed-library) for more information.

And, the cool part is, you can even create your own unique style if you want to give these components a personal touch.

> Note: If you want to create your own design system with these components, it's advisable to refer to the customization guide available [guide](https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/guides/building-design-systems).

```jsx
import { GluestackUIProvider, Button, ButtonText } from '@gluestack-ui/themed';
function App() {
  return (
    <GluestackUIProvider>
      <Button backgroundColor="purple" padding={12}>
        <ButtonText color="white">Hello world</ButtonText>
      </Button>
    </GluestackUIProvider>
  );
}
```

When we use the `GluestackUIProvider`, it doesn't come with any pre-defined styles. So, by default, all the components you get from `@gluestack-ui/themed` are unstyled.

However, you can make these components look the way you want by adding your own unique styles.

## Custom Components

> Note: Using custom components is recommended in case you are building your own design system and want to create everything from scratch.

Let's try creating an unstyled Button component

We utilize a function named `createButton` for the creation of a customized button component. This function accepts a configuration object that contains the styled components you wish to apply to the button. For guidance on the usage of styled components, you can refer [gluestack.io/style](/style) function expects an object containing the styled components that can be tailored to meet your specifications. These styled components can be generated using the `styled` function, which is exported by `@gluestack-style/react`. Here is a basic example provided below.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
    function App() {
      const Root = styled(Pressable, {});
      const Text = styled(RNText, {});
      const Group = styled(View, {});
      const GroupHSpacer = styled(View, {});
      const GroupVSpacer = styled(View, {});
      const Spinner = styled(ActivityIndicator, {});
      // Understanding the API
      const Button = createButton({
        Root,
        Text,
        Group,
        GroupHSpacer,
        GroupVSpacer,
        Spinner,
      });
      return (
        <Button.Group>
          <Button>
            <Button.Text sx={{_dark:{
              color:"white"
            }}}>Hello world</Button.Text>
          </Button>
        </Button.Group>
      );
    }
`,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code, 'function', 'App');
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        styled,
        createButton,
        Pressable,
        RNText,
        View,
        ActivityIndicator,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

In the above example, we are creating an accessible, universal `Button` component by using `createButton` function exported by `@gluestack-ui/button` package. We create various unstyled library using the API employed by `styled` function. These components are then passed as arguments to `createButton` function. Likewise, for each component, there exists a distinct package and API, specified in the documentation of the respective components.

Styling these components is achieved with the aid of the `@gluestack-style/react` library. We generate styled components and encapsulate them within an object, which is then provided as input to the function.
