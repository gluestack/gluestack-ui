# Universal

All `@gluestack-ui/themed` components are universal out of the box, eliminating the need for separate development for both web and mobile platforms, which is the traditional approach.

With `gluestack-ui`, developers can now craft beautiful interfaces with a single set of code that seamlessly operates across all devices, removing the need for the tedious and time-consuming process of crafting and maintaining two separate codebases for distinct platforms.

You can also use `gluestack-ui` to create styles specific to a particular platform such as Web, iOS or Android. using `_web`, `_ios` and `_android` respectively.

```jsx
import { Button, ButtonText} from 'gluestack-ui/themed';

function App {

  return (
    <Button 
        sx={{ 
          _web: { backgroundColor: 'red' },  
          _ios: { backgroundColor: 'blue' },  
          _android: { backgroundColor: 'green' } 
        }}>
     <ButtonText>Hello World</ButtonText>
    </Button>
  )
}
```
