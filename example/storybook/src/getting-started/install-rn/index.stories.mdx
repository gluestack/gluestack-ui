# Install in React Native project

You can create a new React Native project using [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native). `gluestack-ui` provides a CLI to help you get started with the library. It includes initial installation setup and adding components to your project.

To get started with `gluestack-ui`, you can install it using `npx` to do initial setup and add any desired component package.

### Step 1: Initialiser

To do the initial setup run:

```bash
npx gluestack-ui@latest init
```

This will:

- Check if gluestack-ui is installed in the project, if not it will create a `gluestack.config.ts` file at the root of project which will have the default theme.
- It will create `GluestackUIProvider` (Wrapper component)
- It will add `styled` function created using [FontResolver](https://dank.style/docs/plugins/fonts-plugin) and [AnimationResolver](https://dank.style/docs/plugins/animation-plugin) plugins.
- Installs the required dependencies
  - `@dank-style/react`
  - `@dank-style/animation-plugin`
  - `@gluestack-ui/provider`

<br />

### Step 2: Setup provider

`GluestackUIProvider` is a component that makes the aliases and tokens available throughout your app. It uses React's Context API. Add `GluestackUIProvider` to the root of your app and update `App.tsx` as follows:

```jsx
import { Text } from 'react-native';
import { GluestackUIProvider } from './components';
import { config } from './gluestack-ui.config';

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <GluestackUIProvider config={config.theme}>
      <Text>Hello World!</Text>
    </GluestackUIProvider>
  );
}
```

For components to work properly we need to wrap our components with `<GluestackUIProvider />` and pass the theme from `gluestack-ui.config.ts` file.

### Step 3: Component Adder

We can add a new component using npx `npx gluestack-ui@latest add <package-name>`. For example, to add the button component package, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx gluestack-ui@latest add button
```

This will install the `@gluestack-ui/button` package and add it to your project's dependencies. This will add the necessary code to your project, including importing the `createButton` function and creating a `Button` component using it.

### Run the Hello World example:

After installing the component, you can use it in your app by importing it and rendering it in your JSX. For example:

```jsx
import { GluestackUIProvider, Button } from './components';
import { config } from './gluestack-ui.config';

function App() {
  return (
    <GluestackUIProvider config={config.theme}>
      <Button onPress={() => alert('Clicked!')}>
        <Button.Text>Click me!</Button.Text>
      </Button>
    </GluestackUIProvider>
  );
}
```

Yey! you are all set, start editing App.tsx now.
