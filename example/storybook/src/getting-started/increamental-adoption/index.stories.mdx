# Increamental Adoption

Incremental adoption is a strategy for implementing changes gradually instead of all at once. It allows for a smoother transition and minimizes disruption to existing systems and processes. By taking small steps and making incremental improvements, organizations can mitigate risks and ensure that the changes are well-received by stakeholders. This approach is particularly useful for complex projects or when there is resistance to change.

## Some Pre-Requisites:

### If you are building a Web-only app:

- Install React Native Web
  - `npm install react-dom react-native-web`
  - For build-time optimizations, install the babel plugin as well - `npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-native-web`
- If it’s a typescript project install React Native types as well - `npm i @types/react-native`
- Install `@gluestack-ui/themed` and follow the steps mentioned in the [Docs](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/guides/install-nextjs) according to your use case.

### If you are building a universal app:

- Install `@gluestack-ui/themed`
  - Follow [these](https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/guides/install-expo) steps if you are using Expo
  - Follow [these](https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/guides/install-rn) steps if you are using React Native Bare App.

## How to incremently add @gluestack-ui/themed to your Project?

Suppose you have a project that is already deployed on production and you are using a component library named `X-Components`. Now, since your app/website is becoming popular you want to provide a smooth and fast experience to all your users, but you want to start today and gradually update by keeping on improving your app.

Don’t worry, we’ve got your back! All you need to get started is 4 steps-

- Install all the prerequisites (Which most probably you already did).
- Create a config file named `gluestack-ui.config.ts` and export your config from there.
- Use `GluestackUIProvider` and wrap the root of your app.
- Now you can replace your components that you were importing from `X-Components`, with Box from `@gluestack-ui/themed`

That’s it!

Similarly, when needed you can replace the components from `X-Components` with components from `@gluestack-ui/themed`. By following this approach, you can incrementally adopt `@gluestack-ui/themed` and improve your app step by step.

## What if you had some customizations in older components?

If you had made customizations to the older components from `X-Components` or the design from `X-Components` is completely different from `@gluestack-ui/themed`, you can still incorporate those customizations into the new components from `@gluestack-ui/themed`. The theming capabilities of `@gluestack-ui/themed` allow you to customize the appearance of the components to match your specific requirements.

There are 2 ways you can customize your theme:

- Using `createComponents` & `createStyle` API:

  ```jsx
  // gluestack-ui.config.ts
  export const config = createConfig({
    aliases: {},
    tokens: {},
    themes: {},
    globalStyles: {}
  } as const);

  type Config = typeof config;

  // components
  export const components = createComponents({
    Box: createStyle({
       theme: {},
       componentConfig: {
        descendants: [],
        ancestors: [],
        resolvedProps: [],
       },
    }),
    Text: createStyle( {
      ...
   })
  })

  type Components = typeof components;

  declare module '@gluestack-style/react' {
    interface ICustomConfig extends Config {}
    interface ICustomComponents extends Components {}
  }
  ```

  ```jsx
  // App.tsx
  import { config, components } from './gluestack-ui.config.ts';

  export default function ({ children }) {
    return (
      <StyledProvider config={config} components={components}>
        {children}
      </StyledProvider>
    );
  }
  ```

### API Reference

- `createConfig` - To define core config
- `createStyle` - Defines `style/theme` of component
- `createComponents`Define key value pair of component name and theme

- Using npx cli tool or copying the theme folder and eject the complete styling of `@gluestack-ui/themed`.
  - on the root of your project run `npx gluestack-ui-scripts eject-theme` or you can copy this [folder](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/tree/main/packages/config/src) in your project and import everything from this folder and
