# Overriding styles

### SX

- Dank supports the use of an **`sx`** prop to override styles. The **`sx`** prop allows you to pass an object that supports tokens, media queries, nesting and token-aware values to the component.
- `sx` accepts the same style object as the base style.

```tsx
<Button
  size="large"
  sx={{
    style: {
      marginBottom: '$4',
      bg: 'pink',
    },
    state: {
      hover: {
        style: {
          bg: 'orange',
        },
      },
    },
  }}
>
  <Button.Text>Button</Button.Text>
<Button>
```

- In this example, the button will have a pink background instead of default primary, because we have overridden the backgroundColor style by passing it in the **`sx`** prop.
- The **`sx`** prop is particularly useful when working with theming and responsive styles, as it allows you to easily change the styles of a component based on the theme or viewport size.
- It is also important to note that you should always avoid using `sx` prop as it adds to the complexity of style calculations and hence decreases your performance.

### Utility props

We know the whole structure of writing your styles in `sx` props way is a bit tricky to learn hence we also provide you with the ability to pass down utility props on any Styled Component, we internally convert this to `sx` prop (We are also working on a babel plugin that does this at build time to save time for this conversion).

### How to write utility props?

There is a simple rule, always start your props with a media query token first if you are styling for responsive design, and after that just keep writing the conditions with a hyphen in between texts and the suggestions from the typescript will take care of the rest. Here is a demo of the syntax.

```jsx
<StyledView
  borderColor="$grey600"
  active-hover-borderColor="$grey700"
  md-dark-bg="$primary200"
  md-light-bg="$primary700"
/>
```

This will turn into :

```jsx
<StyledView
  sx={{
    style: { borderColor: '$grey600' },
    state: { active: { state: { style: { borderColor: '$grey700' } } } },
    queries: [
      {
        condition: '$md',
        value: {
          colorMode: {
            dark: { style: { bg: '$primary200' } },
            light: { style: { bg: '$primary700' } },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>
```

You can see for yourself how tedious writing inline styles in sx can be hence you should use utility props for overriding your styles.

> Warning: However like all good things writing inline styles take a toll on performance. So we highly recommend you keep it to a minimum.
