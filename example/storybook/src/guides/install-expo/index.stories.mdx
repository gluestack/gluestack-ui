## New Project

If you are starting with a new project, you can use `npx` to create a new project with `gluestack-ui`.

```bash
npm create gluestack
```

The above command will create a new Expo project with `@gluestack-ui/themed` installed and configured.

You can directly use all the components by directly importing them in your project.

```bash
import { Button } from '@gluestack-ui/themed';
```

## Existing Project

Create a new Expo projects if it doesn't already exist

```bash
npm install --global expo-cli
expo init my-project
cd my-project/
```

[Refer this link](https://docs.expo.dev/index.html) for additional information on Expo and setting up an Expo starter app.

If you wish to install `gluestack-ui` into your existing project, you can proceed with the following steps:

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
yarn add @gluestack-ui/themed @gluestack-style/react react-native-svg@13.4.0
```

OR

```bash
npm i @gluestack-ui/themed @gluestack-style/react react-native-svg@13.4.0
```

### Step 2: Configure the GluestackUIProvider

The `GluestackUIProvider` is a component that provides aliases and tokens throughout your app, using React's Context API. It should be added to the root of your app.

You can update your `App.tsx` file as follows:

```jsx
import { GluestackUIProvider, Text, Box } from "@gluestack-ui/themed";
import { config } from "@gluestack-ui/config";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GluestackUIProvider config={config}>
      <Box width="100%" justifyContent="center" alignItems="center">
        <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
      </Box>
    </GluestackUIProvider>
  );
}
```

This ensures that all components are wrapped with `<GluestackUIProvider />`, and the theme from `@gluestack-ui/config` is applied.

This guide should help you get started with gluestack-ui in your expo project. If you run into any issues or have further questions, please refer to the official documentation or community forums.
