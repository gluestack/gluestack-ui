# Building Design Systems

Empower your development by creating a personalized design system with `gluestack-ui`.
This enables you to build your own collection of components that match your vision.

## Step 1: Create Your Own Package

If you are planning to build your own design system, you can direclty **fork** [`@gluestack-ui/themed`](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui) â€“ a meticulously organized monorepo and begin shaping your design system upon this solid foundation.

- This includes a component library package `@gluestack-ui/themed` in `packages/themed` directory.
- This includes a storybook for both React and React Native in `example/storybook` directory.

Follow these steps after **forking** this repository:

### Change library name

- Navigate to the `packages/themed` and open `package.json`. (You can rename the folder if you need).
- Locate the `name` field in the `package.json` file and update it to `@myapp/components`.

  ```json
  //package.json
  {
    "name": "@myapp/components"
    // ...
  }
  ```

  Now your library `@myapp/components` has all primitive components from `@gluestack-ui/themed` by default.

### Update storybook configuration

Navigate to the `example/storybook` and make updates to the specified files below.

- **_tsconfig.json_**:

  You'll need to update `paths` in `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript import resolution.

  ```jsx
  // ... other configuration
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
      "paths": {
        "@myapp/components": ["../../packages/themed/src"],
      },
      // ...
  }
  ```

- **_babel.config.js_**:
  You'll need to update `alias` in `babel.config.ts` file incase you've renamed the folder `packages/themed`.
  ```jsx
  // ... other configuration
    plugins: [
         [
            'module-resolver',
            {
              alias: {
                '@gluestack-ui/themed': path.join(
                __dirname,
                '../../packages/<component-folder-name>/src'
              ),
              }
            },
          ]
    ],
  // ... other configuration
  ```

## Step 2: Customize Tokens and Components

### Theme Tokens

Theme tokens and other configuration is present in `packages/themed/src/components/gluestack-ui.config.ts`. You have the flexibility to modify these tokens as per your requirements.

Check [this](/ui/docs/theme-configuration/customizing-theme) for more details.

### Components

You can customize the styling of all primitive components. You can modify styling in `packages/themed/src/components/<ComponentName>/styled-components` for a particular component. You can add and modify property value and variants based on your need.

**Create a custom component**
To create your own custom commponent. You need to follow these steps:

- Create a folder inside `packages/themed/src/components/Circle`
- Create a folder `styled-components/` inside `packages/themed/src/components/Circle` to keep all styling.
- Style your component using `@gluestack-style/react` in `Root.tsx`
  ```jsx
  export const Root = styled(View, {
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    borderRadius: '$full',
    overflow: 'hidden',
    variants: {
      size: {
        large: {
          width: 100,
          height: 100,
        },
      },
    },
  });
  ```
- For other functionalities like accessibility and events, create an `index.tsx` file `packages/themed/src/components/Circle/index.tsx` and export it.

  ```jsx
  import { Root } from './styled-components';

  const Circle = (props) => {
    return <Root {...props}>{props.children}</Root>;
  };
  ```

- And then export from `packages/themed/src/components/index.tsx`
  ```jsx
  // other components
  export * from './Circle';
  ```

## Step 3: Test Your Package

Now you can import and test your component.

```jsx
import { Circle } from '@myapp/components';
export default () => <Circle size="large" />;
```

## Step 4: Publish Your Package

Now you can publish your design system as a package from `packages/themed`.

## Step 5: Integrate it in Your App

Once published, you can use `@myapp/components` in your app you need add it to your `package.json` and update your configuration.

#### Next.js

Update **_next.config.js_**:

```jsx
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const { withGluestackUI } = require('@gluestack/ui-next-adapter');

const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  transpilePackages: ['@myapp/components'],
};

module.exports = withGluestackUI(nextConfig);
```

#### Expo

No need to update any config for Expo.
