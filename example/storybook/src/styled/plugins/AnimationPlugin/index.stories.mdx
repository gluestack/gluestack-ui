# Animation Plugin

gluestack-style offers a plugin that supports animation properties, utilizing animation libraries such as [@legendapp/motion](https://legendapp.com/open-source/motion/), [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), and [moti](https://moti.fyi/). We will use `@legendapp/motion` in this example.

## Installation:

```bash
# using npm

npm install @gluestack-style/animation-resolver

# using yarn

yarn add @gluestack-style/animation-resolver
```

## How to use:

### Initialization of the plugin:

- You can initialize the Animation plugin by creating a new instance of the AnimationResolver class and pass it inside config. The `AnimationResolver` takes an optional `styledUtils` object that maps the styled utils object. Here's an example:

> By default, the plugin aliases `@legendapp/motion` properties.

```jsx
import { AnimationResolver } from '@gluestack-style/animation-resolver';

export const config = {
  aliases: {},
  tokens: {},
  plugins: [new AnimationResolver()],
};
```

- In this example, we are creating a new instance of the AnimationResolver class, passing an object with the 'aliases' property as an argument. The aliases object maps the aliases :initial, :animate, and :exit to their corresponding animation props.

### Example of creating a styled component:

- Once the plugin is initialized, you can use the `styled` function to create styled components with animation props. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { AnimatedView } from '@gluestack-style/animation-resolver';

const Box = styled(AnimatedView, {
  ':initial': { opacity: 0 },
  ':animate': { opacity: 1 },
  ':exit': { opacity: 0 },
});
```

The final internal styled object that will be resolved is:

```jsx
styledObject = {
  'props': {
    initial: {
      opacity: 0,
    },
    animate: {
      opacity: 1,
    },
    exit: {
      opacity: 0,
    },
    }
  },
};
```

## Exit animation:

- The Animation plugin provides a `AnimatePresence` component. Internally, it utilizes `AnimatePresence` from activated animation driver to check if any component is removed from the React tree, aiding in exit animations. Here's an example:

We used the styled component below to create the above example:

```jsx
const StyledMotionImage = styled(AnimatedImage, {
  ':animate': {
    zIndex: 1,
    x: 0,
    opacity: 1,
  },
});
```

In this example, we're using the `AnimatePresence`, provided by the animation resolver, to wrap the Box component. Internally, it uses `AnimatePresence` from activated animation driver. Here is an [expo snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@gluestack/bounce-animation?platform=web) for a more complete example.
