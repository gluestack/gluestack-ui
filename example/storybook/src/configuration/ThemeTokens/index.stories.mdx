## Theme Tokens

To utilize theme tokens, create a config object in `gluestack-ui.config.ts` file (`.js` works too) at your app's root level, including all the design tokens you intend to use in your application. Here is an example of a theme object:

```js
import { createConfig } from 'gluestack-style/react';

const config = {
  componentPath: '/components',
  theme: createConfig({
    aliases: {
      bg: 'backgroundColor',
      p: 'padding',
      h: 'height',
      w: 'width',
    },
    tokens: {
      colors: {
        primary: 'blue',
        secondary: 'green',
        text: 'black',
        background: 'white',
      },
      fonts: {
        body: 'Arial, sans-serif',
        heading: 'Georgia, serif',
      },
      fontSizes: {
        small: '12px',
        medium: '16px',
        large: '20px',
      },
      space: { 0: 0, 1: 4, 2: 8, 4: 16, 8: 32 },
    },
    globalStyle: {
      // ...
    },
  } as const),
}
```

- componentPath: The path to your components directory. This is used to navigate the path of `gluestack-ui` components by `gluestack-ui-cli`.

- aliases: This is useful when you want to use a shorter name for a token. For example, you can use `bg` instead of `backgroundColor` for the `backgroundColor` token.

- tokens: This is where you define your design tokens.

You can refer to [gluestack-style](https://style.gluestack.io/docs/configuration/theme-tokens) for more information aliases, tokens and globalStyle.

## Update Tokens

To update the theme tokens to the latest version, you can execute the following command in the same directory where `gluestack-ui.config.ts` or `gluestack-ui.config.js` file is located. Typically, this file is present in the root directory of the project:

```bash
npx gluestack-ui@latest
```
