# Eject Command

`gluestack-ui-scripts` exports an `eject` command that

- ejects all the components and gluestack-ui theme in `gluestack-ui-components` folder.
- For Next Apps an alias of '@gluestack-ui/react' is added which will use the components from `./components` now.

```bash
# ejects all the components and the config file
yarn gluestack-ui-scripts eject
```

OR

```bash
npm run gluestack-ui-scripts eject
```

Incase of Expo application, we need to add a module resolver and update babel.config.js with the following code:

```jsx
const path = require('path');
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      [
        'module-resolver',
        {
          alias: {
            '@gluestack-ui/react': path.join(__dirname, './components'),
          },
        },
      ],
    ],
  };
};
```
