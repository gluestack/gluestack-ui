# NativeBase to gluestack-ui

`gluestack-ui` comes with major changes in philosophy as well as the API. With gluestack, we have re-imagined how we should code for React Native and the web. Therefore, you might encounter a few changes while migrating from NativeBase to gluestack-ui. Even though it might seem a bit of tedious work, we promise it will be worth it!
Please refer to [this](https://geekyants.notion.site/NativeBase-to-gluestack-ui-Migration-Plan-WIP-6409006d9ecc4fb2a559cca6117a3e7c) guide while migrating from NativeBase to gluestack-ui.
