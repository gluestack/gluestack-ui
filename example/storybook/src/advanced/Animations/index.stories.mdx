# Animations

gluestack-ui leverages the power of the [Animation plugin](https://style.gluestack.io/docs/plugins/animation-plugin) from [style.gluestack.io](https://style.gluestack.io) to provide animations for a more engaging user experience. By default, all of our animated components are built using the [@legendapp/motion](https://legendapp.com/open-source/motion/), which provides declarative animations for React Native.

### Usage:

By default, gluestack-ui exports styled function with `animation plugin` enabled. You can use it to create your own animated components.

```jsx
const Box = styled(Motion.View, {
  ':initial': {
    opacity: 0,
  },
  ':animate': {
    opacity: 1,
  },
  ':exit': {
    opacity: 0,
  },
});
```

## Overlay components:

gluestack-ui also provides a set of overlay components that can be used to create a modal-like experience. All the animation props works out of the box with these components. However, to animate component on exit you need to pass [AnimatePresence](https://legendapp.com/open-source/motion/animate-presence/) while creating component.

If you are using [@legendapp/motion](https://legendapp.com/open-source/motion/), you can use `<component-name>.AnimatePresence`, which internally uses `AnimatePresence` from `@legendapp/motion`.

### Why <ComponentName>.AnimatePresence and not AnimatePresence from @legendapp/motion?

For exit animation, `@legendapp/motion` internally loops over children and tries to find the `exit` prop directly. However, with our wrapper component, we can pass the `exit` prop to the component, and it will work as expected with `AnimatePresence`.

> Note: If you are using any other animation library, you can use `AnimatePresence` or something similar(which animates component on exit) from your library.

### Example:

```jsx
export const Tooltip = createTooltip({
  Root,
  Content,
  AnimatePresence: Content.AnimatePresence, // Can be AnimatePresence from the library you are using
});
```

## Advanced concepts for animations in gluestack-ui

However, you are not limited to use only that library. You can use any declarative animation library you prefer, such as [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), and [moti](https://moti.fyi/), or others. You can add aliases for animation props from your library. For example, if you are using moti, you can add aliases for `from`, `animate`, and `exit` props.

You can refer to [animation plugin](https://style.gluestack.io/docs/plugins/animation-plugin) documentation for more details.
