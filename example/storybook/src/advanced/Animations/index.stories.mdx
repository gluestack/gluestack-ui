# Animations

gluestack-ui leverages the power of the [Animation plugin](/style/docs/plugins/animation-plugin) from [gluestack.io/style](/style) to provide animations for a more engaging user experience. By default, all of our animated components are built using the [@legendapp/motion](https://legendapp.com/open-source/motion/), which provides declarative animations for React Native.

### Usage:

By default, gluestack-ui/themed comes with with `animation plugin` plugin installed with `@legendapp/motion` animation driver. You can use the Animatable Components from `@gluestack-style/animation-resolver` and from them you can create your own animated components.

```jsx
import { AnimatedView } from '@gluestack-style/animation-resolver';
import { styled } from '@gluestack-style/react';

const AnimatedBox = styled(AnimatedView, {
  ':initial': {
    opacity: 0,
  },
  ':animate': {
    opacity: 1,
  },
  ':exit': {
    opacity: 0,
  },
});
```

or You can also extend the style of the animated components and customize it.

```jsx
const componentTheme = createComponents({
  ...defaultConfig.components,
  ModalContent: {
    theme: {
      ':initial': {
        bg: 'white',
      },
    },
  },
});

// Pass this componentTheme in the provider.
```

## Overlay components:

gluestack-ui also provides a set of overlay components that can be used to create a modal-like experience. All the animation props works out of the box with these components. However, to animate component on exit you need to pass [AnimatePresence](https://legendapp.com/open-source/motion/animate-presence/) while creating component.

If you can use `AnimatePresence` from `@gluestack-style/animation-resolver`, which internally uses `AnimatePresence` from your chosen driver.

### Example:

```jsx
import { AnimatePresence } from '@gluestack-style/animation-resolver';

export const Tooltip = createTooltip({
  Root,
  Content,
  AnimatePresence, // Can be AnimatePresence from the library you are using
});
```

## Advanced concepts for animations in gluestack-ui

However, you are not limited to use only `@legendapp/motion`. You can use any declarative animation library you prefer, such as [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), and [moti](https://moti.fyi/), or others. You can add your own animation driver to the `animation-resolver` plugin and use it with gluestack-ui. Currently we only provide 2 drivers, `@legendapp/motion` and `moti`.

You can refer to [customizing animations](/ui/docs/theme-configuration/customizing-theme) section's documentation for more details on customizing the Animation Components.
