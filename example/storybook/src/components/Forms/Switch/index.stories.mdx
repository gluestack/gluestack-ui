## Basic

Following is the default implementation of the **Switch** component without any additional customization. This serves as a starting point for users who are new to this library and want to learn about the basic functionality and appearance of the component.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
function Example(){
  const [isEnabled, setIsEnabled] = React.useState(false);
  const toggleSwitch = () => setIsEnabled(previousState => !previousState);
  return (
    <Switch
      onValueChange={toggleSwitch}
      value={isEnabled}
    />
  );
}
`,
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Switch,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

## Installation

```

### API Reference

The following section contains a comprehensive list of the component's references, including descriptions, properties, types, and default behavior. This information is readily available for you to access, helping you effectively utilize the component library in your projects.

#### Switch

Contains all switch related layout style props and actions.
It inherits all the properties of React Native's [Switch](https://reactnative.dev/docs/switch#props) component.

### Dependencies

The following are the lists of all the libraries and packages the component relies on. This information will help you ensure that your project has all the necessary dependencies installed to use the component.

- `@gluestack-ui/utils`
- `@react-native-aria/focus`

### Examples

The Examples section provides visual representations of the different variants of the component, allowing you to quickly and easily determine which one best fits your needs. Simply copy the code and integrate it into your project.

#### Sizes

Switch component comes in different sizes, such as sm and lg, allowing users to adjust the switch size based on their design needs.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
<VStack space="md">
  <Switch size="sm" />
  <Switch size="lg" />
</VStack>
`,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return `function Example(){
  const [isEnabled1, setIsEnabled1] = React.useState(false);
  const [isEnabled2, setIsEnabled2] = React.useState(false);
  const toggleSwitch1 = () => setIsEnabled1(previousState => !previousState);
  const toggleSwitch2 = () => setIsEnabled2(previousState => !previousState);
  return (
<VStack space="md">
    <Switch
      onValueChange={toggleSwitch1}
      value={isEnabled1}
      size="sm" 
    />
    <Switch
      onValueChange={toggleSwitch2}
      value={isEnabled2}
      size="lg" 
    />
</VStack>
  );
}`;
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Switch,
        VStack,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

## Advanced

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the Switch

We have a function called `createSwitch` which can be used to create a custom switch component. This function takes in a configuration object which contains the styled components that you want to use for the switch. You can refer [dank.style](https://dank.style/) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of all these components can be found in the `components/core/switch` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/development/example/storybook/src/components/Switch/index.tsx) of the styled `Switch` components.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/switch/styled-components';

// import the createSwitch function
import { createSwitch } from '@gluestack-ui/switch';

// Understanding the API
const Switch = createSwitch({
  Root,
});

// Using the switch component
export default () => <Switch />;
```
