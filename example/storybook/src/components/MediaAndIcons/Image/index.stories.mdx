## Basic

Following is the default implementation of the **Image** component without any additional customization. This serves as a starting point for users who are new to this library and want to learn about the basic functionality and appearance of the component.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    _rendererWrapper={{
      py: '$8',
      px: '$8',
    }}
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={true}
    metaData={{
      code: `
       <Image
       {...props}
         source={{
            uri: 'https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/04/23/22/00/tree-736885__480.jpg',
          }}
      />
      `,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code);
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Image,
      },
      argsType: {
        size: {
          control: 'select',
          options: ['2xs', 'xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl', '2xl'],

### Anatomy

The structure provided below can help you identify and understand a Image component's various parts.

```

### API Reference

The following section contains a comprehensive list of the component's references, including descriptions, properties, types, and default behavior. This information is readily available for you to access, helping you effectively utilize the component library in your projects.

#### Image

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image#props) component.

## Advanced

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the Image

For customizing the Image, you have to map styled Image to Image. You can refer [style.gluestack.io](https://style.gluestack.io/) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### How to use Next.js Image

By default, Image component uses Native Image component. If you want to use Next.js Image component, you have to create a new styled component for image and map it to Image component. You can also change the already present styled-component for images on the path `./components/core/button/styled-components` in your project.

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';


// Using the Next Image component
const StyledImage = styled(Image, styling, componentConfig, extenedBaseConfig);

// if some styling are direct props, you can pass them as props in the styling
props: {
  w: 100,
  h: 100,
  borderRadius: '$full',
}

// you can also https://style.gluestack.io/docs/getting-started/styled to style the component


export default () => <StyledImage />;
```

#### How to use Expo Image

In expo, Image component doesn't accept dataSet prop in the components. So, you have to pass config to not optimize the Image component on web in the styled function to make it work.

```jsx
import Image from 'expo-image';

// Using the Expo Image component
const StyledImage = styled(Image, styling, componentConfig, extenedBaseConfig);

export default () => <StyledImage />;
```

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/core/image` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/development/example/storybook/src/ui-components/Image/index.tsx) of the styled `Image` component.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/image/styled-components';

// mapping the Image to root component
const Image = Root;

// Using the Image component
export default () => <Image />;
```
