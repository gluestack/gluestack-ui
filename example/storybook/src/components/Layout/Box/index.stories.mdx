### Component Props

This section provides a comprehensive reference list for the component props, detailing descriptions, properties, types, and default behavior for easy project integration.

#### Box

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) component.

## Themed

The themed version of the component is a pre-styled version of the component, which allows you to quickly integrate the component into your project. The component's design and functionality are fully defined, allowing you to focus on the more important aspects of your project. To know more about Themed Library please visit this [link](https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/core-concepts/themed-library).

### Examples

The Examples section provides visual representations of the different variants of the component, allowing you to quickly and easily determine which one best fits your needs. Simply copy the code and integrate it into your project.

#### Box with ref

A Box component with a ref property enables the direct reference and manipulation of the underlying DOM element, offering greater control and flexibility in modifying the box's appearance and behavior within a user interface.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
        function App () {
          const myRef = useRef({});
          useEffect(() => {
            const styleObj = {
              borderWidth: 2,
              borderRadius: 4,
              borderColor: '#1A91FF',
            };
          if(myRef.current && myRef.current.setNativeProps){
             myRef.current.setNativeProps({
              style: styleObj,
             });
            }
          }, [myRef]);
        return (
          <Box sx={{ h: 100, w: 100, bg: '$primary100'}} ref={myRef} />
        );
      }
      `,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code, 'function', 'App');
      },
      scope: { Box, Wrapper, useRef, useEffect },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

## Unstyled

All the components in `gluestack-ui` are unstyled by default. To customize your UI using the extendedTheme, please refer to this [link](https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/theme-configuration/customizing-theme). The import names of components serve as keys to customize each component.

<!--
### Customizing the Box

For customizing the Box, you have to map styled view to Box. You can refer [gluestack.io/style](/style) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/box` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/main/packages/themed/src/components/Box) of the styled `Box` component.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/box/styled-components';

// mapping the Box to root component
const Box = Root;

// using the Box component
export default () => <Box />;
```
