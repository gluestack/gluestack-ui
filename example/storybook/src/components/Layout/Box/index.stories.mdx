## Advanced

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the Box

For customizing the Box, you have to map styled view to Box. You can refer [dank.style](https://dank.style/docs/getting-started/styled) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/box` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/main/example/storybook/src/ui-components/Box/index.tsx) of the styled `Box` component.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/box/styled-components';

// mapping the Box to root component
const Box = Root;

// Using the Box component
export default () => (
  <Box>
    <Text />
  </Box>
);
```
