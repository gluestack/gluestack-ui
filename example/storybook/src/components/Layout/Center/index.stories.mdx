#### Center

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) component.

## Unstyled

All the components in `gluestack-ui` are unstyled by default. To customize your UI using the extendedTheme, please refer to this [link](https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/theme-configuration/customizing-theme). The import names of components serve as keys to customize each component.

<!--
### Customizing the Center

For customizing the Center, you have to map styled view to Center. You can refer [gluestack.io/style](/style/docs/getting-started/styled) on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of the component can be found in the `components/center` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/main/packages/themed/src/components/Center) of the styled `Center` component.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/center/styled-components';

// mapping the Center to root component
const Center = Root;

// using the Center component
export default () => <Center />;
```
