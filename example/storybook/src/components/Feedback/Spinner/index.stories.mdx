    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
<Spinner size="large" />
`,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code);
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Spinner,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

## Installation

```bash
npx gluestack-ui@latest add spinner
```

### Import

To use the component in your project, run the command below into your import statement. This will import the component from your components folder.

```bash
import { Spinner } from './components';
```

### Anatomy

The structure provided below can help you identify and understand a Spinner component's various parts.

```jsx
export default () => <Spinner />;
```

### API Reference

The following section contains a comprehensive list of the component's references, including descriptions, properties, types, and default behavior. This information is readily available for you to access, helping you effectively utilize the component library in your projects.

#### Spinner

Contains all Spinner related layout style props and actions.
It inherits all the properties of React Native's [ActivityIndicator](https://reactnative.dev/docs/activityindicator#props) component.

## Advanced

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the Spinner

We have a function called `createSpinner` which can be used to create a custom `Spinner` component. This function takes in a configuration object which contains the styled components that you want to use for the spinner. You can refer [dank.style](https://dank.style/) for more information on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of all these components can be found in the `components/core/spinner` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/development/example/storybook/src/components/Spinner/index.tsx) of the styled `Spinner` components.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/spinner/styled-components';

// import the createSpinner function
import { createSpinner } from '@gluestack-ui/spinner';

// Understanding the API
const Spinner = createSpinner({
  Root,
});

// Using the spinner component
export default () => <Spinner />;
```
