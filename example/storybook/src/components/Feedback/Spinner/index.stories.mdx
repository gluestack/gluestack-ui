#### Spinner with Label

A Spinner component with a label provides informative text or a label alongside the spinner, offering descriptive context and improving user understanding and interaction with the spinner element within a user interface.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
        <HStack space="sm" >
          <Spinner/>
          <Text size="md">Please Wait</Text>
        </HStack>
      `,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code);
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Spinner,
        HStack,
        Text,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

#### Color Scheme

A Spinner component with a color scheme enhances visual appeal by incorporating distinct colors, adding a touch of customization and style to the spinner element within a user interface.

<AppProvider>
  <CodePreview
    showComponentRenderer={true}
    showArgsController={false}
    metaData={{
      code: `
      <VStack space="md" >
        <Spinner color="$indigo600" />
        <Spinner color="$emerald600" />
        <Spinner color="$amber600" />
        <Spinner color="$fuchsia600" />
      </VStack>
    `,
      transformCode: (code) => {
        return transformedCode(code);
      },
      scope: {
        Wrapper,
        Spinner,
        VStack,
      },
      argsType: {},
    }}
  />
</AppProvider>

## Unstyled

All the components in `gluestack-ui` are unstyled by default. To customize your UI using the extendedTheme, please refer to this [link](https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/theme-configuration/customizing-theme). The import names of components serve as keys to customize each component.

<!--

### Advanced

We provide in-depth information on how to customize and extend the component's functionality to meet your needs. Below, we describe how to modify the component to suit your requirements.

### Customizing the Spinner

We have a function called `createSpinner` which can be used to create a custom `Spinner` component. This function takes in a configuration object which contains the styled components that you want to use for the spinner. You can refer [gluestack.io/style](/style/docs/getting-started/styled) on how to use styled components.

#### Usage

Default styling of all these components can be found in the `components/core/spinner` file. For reference, you can view the [source code](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/blob/main/packages/themed/src/components/Spinner) of the styled `Spinner` components.

```jsx
// import the styles
import { Root } from '../components/core/spinner/styled-components';

// import the createSpinner function
import { createSpinner } from '@gluestack-ui/spinner';

// Understanding the API
const Spinner = createSpinner({
  Root,
});

// Using the spinner component
export default () => <Spinner />;
```
