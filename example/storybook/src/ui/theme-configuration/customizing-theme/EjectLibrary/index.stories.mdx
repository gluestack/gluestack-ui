`gluestack-ui` is intentionally designed as an unstyled library, providing you with the flexibility to style your components as you prefer. For users looking for a seamless integration experience, we offer the `@gluestack-ui/config` package, which comes with pre-configured theme that can easily be integrated with `@gluestack-ui/themed` for a convenient styling solution.

> Note: It is NOT RECOMMENDED to both eject theme & library in one project. It is RECOMMENDED to eject library as it provides maximum customization(theme & components), but if you want to customize only the theme, refer [here](/ui/docs/theme-configuration/customizing-theme/eject-theme).    

## Eject Library

Customizing components allows you to tailor the components according to your design system or guidelines to match your project's unique visual identity. To customize tokens and components, follow these steps:

> Note: Commit you changes before ejecting, this command with update the imports!!

1. **Eject**: Run following command to eject the theme. This will create a **components** folder in your project root directory and copy all the styled components.

```bash
npx gluestack-ui-scripts eject
```

> Note: If you have already ejected the theme or components,
This will overwrite the existing styles with default one. (It is NOT RECOMMENDED to eject again)
If you need to eject the components, then save the changes and copy/paste them manually.

2. If you are already using `@gluestack-ui/themed` inside your project, running this command will automatically change the imports from `@gluestack-ui/themed` to the components folder path.

3. Remove the config file passed inside provides at the root of the project. Wrap the root of the project with `GluestackUIProvider` only.

```jsx
<GluestackUIProvider>{children}</GluestackUIProvider>
```

4. **Update Tokens**: go to `components/gluestack-ui.config.ts` file. Update the tokens as per your requirements.

```jsx
// gluestack-ui.config.ts

export const config = createConfig({
  // ...Theme config
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      ...Theme config.tokens.colors,
      // replacing primary color
      primary0: '#ffffff',
      primary50: '#a3fff4',
      primary100: '#82fff0',
      primary200: '#61ffed',
      primary300: '#45fae5',
      primary400: '#24f9e1',
      primary500: '#17f3d9',
      primary600: '#12e4cb',
      primary700: '#17ccb7',
      primary800: '#1ab5a3',
      primary900: '#1c9f90',
      primary950: '#000000',
    },
  },
});

type Config = typeof config;
type Components = typeof components;

declare module '@gluestack-ui/themed' {
  interface UIConfig extends Config {}
  interface UIComponents extends Components {}
}

```
> Note: The updated config will be applied automatically, as it is passed inside `GluestackUIProvider` component located at "./components/gluestack-ui-provider/index.tsx"

You can customize all the tokens of the theme in `config`. For a complete list of tokens and default values, please check [default Tokens](https://gluestack.io/ui/docs/theme-configuration/theme/default-tokens).

5. **Update Components**: you can find all of your components theme inside `./components` folder. For example, if you want to customize `Button` component, you can find its theme file at `./components/button/index.tsx`. Update component's style as per your requirements.

## Customizing Animations

Customizing animations allows you to change the animation behavior of all the animation compatible UI components within the `@gluestack-ui/themed`. Currently customization is limited to the using `moti` or `legend-motion` for Animated Components and is supported via a plugin system. To customize animations, follow these steps:

1. **Update Plugins**: go to `./components/gluestack-ui.config.ts` file. Update the `plugins` property as per your requirements.

```jsx
//gluestack-ui.config.ts

import { config as defaultConfig } from '@gluestack-ui/config';
import { createConfig } from '@gluestack-ui/themed';
import { AnimationResolver } from '@gluestack-style/animation-resolver';
import { MotionDriver } from '@gluestack-style/legend-motion-animation-driver';
import { MotiDriver } from '@gluestack-style/moti-animation-driver';

export const config = createConfig({
  ...defaultConfig
  plugins: [
    ...defaultConfig.plugins,
    // using legend-motion
    new AnimationResolver(MotionDriver,{
      // You can override animated aliases here if you want by default driver have support for all the animated components aliases required.
    }),
    // using moti
    // new AnimationResolver(MotiDriver),
  ],
});

type Config = typeof config;
type Components = typeof components;

declare module '@gluestack-style/react' {
  interface UIConfig extends Config {}
  interface UIComponents extends Components {}
}

```
