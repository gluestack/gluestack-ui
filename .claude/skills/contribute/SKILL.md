# Gluestack-UI Contributor Hub

Welcome to the gluestack-ui contributor skills! This is the main entry point that provides access to all contributor workflows organized as sub-skills.

## Available Sub-Skills

All contributor workflows are organized under the `/contribute` namespace. Use the commands below to access specific workflows:

### 🆕 Component Creation
**Command:** `/create-component`
Create a new React Native/Expo component with a guided, interactive workflow. The agent will:
- Enter plan mode to analyze existing patterns
- Ask comprehensive questions about requirements
- Propose and confirm the component API design
- Discuss tradeoffs and design decisions
- Ensure pattern consistency with existing components
- Implement following the compound component API pattern
- Create complete documentation and examples
- Test across all apps (kitchen-sink, website)

### 🔧 Component Enhancement
**Command:** `/enhance-component`
Improve or extend an existing component with new features, variants, or fixes.

### 📦 Package Development
**Command:** `/create-package`
Create or modify gluestack-core or gluestack-utils packages for component creators and utilities.

### 📝 Documentation
**Command:** `/create-docs`
Create or update component documentation with examples, API reference, and best practices.

### 🧪 Testing
**Command:** `/test-component`
Test components across multiple apps (kitchen-sink, website, starter-kits) to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

### ✅ PR Review
**Command:** `/review-pr`
Pre-submission PR checklist to ensure quality and completeness before creating a pull request.
