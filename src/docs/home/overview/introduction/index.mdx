# Introduction

Customizable components and patterns for React, Next.js & React Native.

**gluestack-ui v3** offers customizable, beautifully designed components for your projects. Unlike traditional libraries, it's not a pre-packaged dependency. Choose the components you need and copy-paste them directly into your React, Next.js & React Native projects.

## Why gluestack-ui v3?

### Evolution to v3

**gluestack-ui v3** represents a major evolution in our approach to universal component development. Building on the foundation of v2, v3 introduces a revolutionary source-to-destination architecture that ensures consistency across all platforms while maintaining maximum flexibility.

#### What's New in v3

- **Source-to-Destination Architecture** *(contribution change)*: All components are maintained in a single source of truth (`src/` directory) and automatically synced across all project templates and examples
- **Enhanced Package System** *(contribution change)*: Modular packages (`gluestack-core`, `gluestack-utils`, `ui-next-adapter`) for better maintainability and extensibility  
- **Improved Developer Experience** *(contribution change)*: Streamlined development workflow with automated file synchronization and hot reloading
- **Advanced Component Creation** *(contribution change)*: New CLI tools and scripts for rapid component development and contribution
- **Better Documentation Integration** *(contribution change)*: Seamless integration between component source code and documentation
- **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure** *(contribution change)*: Comprehensive testing across multiple starter templates and applications

### Key Features of gluestack-ui v3

- **Universal Consistency**: Components work identically across React, Next.js, and React Native with a single codebase

We've prepared a comprehensive migration guide to help you transition smoothly from v2 to v3, including automated migration tools and detailed instructions.

## Why Choose gluestack-ui v3?

### vs. Traditional UI Libraries

Unlike component libraries that force you into their ecosystem:
- **Full Customization**: Modify components to fit your exact needs
- **No Bundle Bloat**: Only include components you actually use
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works across React, Next.js, and React Native

### vs. Building from Scratch

Instead of reinventing the wheel:
- **Production-Ready**: Battle-tested components used by thousands of developers
- **Accessibility Built-in**: ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation included
- **Design System**: Consistent design tokens and theming system
- **Community Support**: Active community and regular updates

### vs. Platform-Specific Solutions

Rather than maintaining separate web and mobile component libraries:
- **Single Codebase**: Write once, run everywhere
- **Consistent UX**: Identical behavior across all platforms
- **Shared Knowledge**: Team members can work across platforms
- **Reduced Maintenance**: One component system to maintain

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

#### Step 1: **Initialize a new project**:
   ```bash
   npx create-gluestack@alpha my-app
   ```

#### Step 2: **Add components to existing project**:
   ```bash
   npx gluestack-ui@alpha init
   npx gluestack-ui@alpha add button
   ```

#### Step 3: **Start building**:
   ```tsx
   import { Button, ButtonText } from '@/components/ui/button'
   
   export default function App() {
     return (
       <Button>
         <ButtonText>Get Started</ButtonText>
       </Button>
     )
   }
   ```

### Supported Frameworks

- **React Native CLI** - Native mobile development with React Native CLI
- **Expo** - Complete Expo SDK compatibility
- **Monorepos** - Full support for monorepo architectures

## Why use gluestack-ui v3, when we already have NativeBase?

**gluestack-ui** was originally part of NativeBase, but it has since evolved into a standalone library with significantly improved performance. It prioritizes performance and is optimized for even complex applications with many elements.

We have also shifted from prop-based APIs in NativeBase to compound APIs because that provides a more cohesive, robust and consistent interface for developers.

## Why use gluestack-ui v3/v2, when we already have gluestack-ui v1?

**gluestack-ui v3/v2** is a major upgrade from **v1**, designed to address the evolving needs of modern developers. With enhanced performance, improved developer experience, and greater flexibility, gluestack-ui v2 offers several advantages over its predecessor:

- **Modular Approach**: Avoid unnecessary bloat by selecting and using only the components you need.
- **Simple Integration**: Easily integrate components by copying and pasting code snippets directly into your project files.
- **Tailwind Class Support**: Enjoy seamless styling with Tailwind's intuitive utility classes with NativeWind.
- **RSC compatible components**: Optimize your applications with components that enhance performance by leveraging React Server Components.
- **Full Customization**: Tailor components to fit your project's needs by adjusting styles and behaviors.

## What will happen to existing gluestack-ui v1 users?

Existing **gluestack-ui v1** users will continue to have access to their current version, but we highly encourage upgrading to gluestack-ui v2 to take advantage of the new features and improvements. Here's what you can expect:

- **Continued Support**: We will provide maintenance and support for gluestack-ui v1 for a limited time to ensure a smooth transition.
- **Migration Guide**: We have prepared a comprehensive migration guide to help you seamlessly transition from v1 to v2. The guide includes detailed instructions, code examples, and best practices to ease the process. [Link to migration guide](/ui/docs/guides/more/upgrade-to-v2).
- **Enhanced Features**: By upgrading to v3/v2, you will benefit from improved performance, better developer experience, and more customization options.
- **Community and Documentation**: Extensive documentation and an active community will support you through the upgrade process and beyond.
- **Codemod Tool**: Additionally, we've developed a codemod tool to assist with the transition, streamlining the process and reducing manual effort. You can find instructions on how to install the codemod tool in our documentation [here](/ui/docs/home/overview/upgrade-to-v2).

We are committed to making the transition to gluestack-ui v2 as smooth and beneficial as possible for all our users.

## Future Considerations

gluestack-ui is committed to continuously expanding its library of components to meet the needs of developers. We plan to add more components to the library, such as date-time picker, bottom sheet, and more. Apart from that, we are actively working on improving the performance of the styling library using techniques such as bundler-plugins, tree flattening, and more.
