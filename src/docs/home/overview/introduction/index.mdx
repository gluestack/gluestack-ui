# Introduction

Customizable components and patterns for React, Next.js & React Native.

**gluestack-ui** offers customizable, beautifully designed components for your projects. Unlike traditional libraries, it's not a pre-packaged dependency. Choose the components you need and copy-paste them directly into your React, Next.js & React Native projects.

## gluestack-ui philosophy

### Why gluestack-ui exists
- **Problem:** Traditional UI libraries often force developers into rigid patterns, heavy dependencies, or platform-specific implementations.

- **Solution:** Gluestack promotes a universal, modular, and copy-paste approach that lets developers own their UI components completely.

### Goals & Non-Goals

#### Our goals

- **Universal Consistency:** One codebase, same behavior across React, Next.js, and React Native.

- **Developer Ownership:** Copy-paste components, modify freely, avoid vendor lock-in.

- **Performance & Accessibility:** Lightweight, optimized, and accessible components by default.

- **Community-Driven:** Open architecture encouraging contributions and experimentation.

#### Non-goals

**We don't aim to**
- Create another monolithic UI library with hundreds of pre-styled components
- Provide opinionated design themes that limit creative freedom
- Replace platform-specific optimizations with lowest-common-denominator solutions
- Build a proprietary styling system that requires learning new APIs
- Create dependencies that become bottlenecks for your project's evolution

### How gluestack-ui works

- **Source-to-Destination Architecture:** Maintain a single source of truth for components that automatically syncs across projects.

- **Copy-Paste Components:** Grab only what you need—no heavy dependencies required.

- **Theming & Tailwind Integration:** Flexible styling system that works for web & mobile.

- **TypeScript & RSC Ready:** Modern architecture for type safety and server-rendered apps.

### Design 101

- **Atomic, Composable Components:** Each component is small, reusable, and composable into more complex UIs.

- **Compound Components:** Components with sub-components (e.g., 
`<Button>`
`<ButtonText>`Click Me`</ButtonText>`
`</Button>`
), allowing more flexible layouts.

- **Accessibility by Default:** ARIA support baked in, keyboard navigable.

- **Minimal Runtime Overhead:** Lightweight runtime ensures high performance.

### Code 101

- **Copy-Paste Philosophy:** No “magical imports.” You copy the component directly into your codebase.

- **Fully Customizable:** You can override styles, props, and behavior easily.

- **Single Source of Truth:** All component logic lives in src/ for maintainability and easy updates.

- **Integration Ready:** Works out-of-the-box with Tailwind, NativeWind, and Next.js RSC.

This philosophy guides every decision in gluestack-ui's development, from API design to documentation structure, ensuring that developers have the tools they need to build exceptional user experiences without compromise.

## Why use gluestack-ui v3, when we already have NativeBase?

**gluestack-ui** was originally part of NativeBase, but it has since evolved into a standalone library with significantly improved performance. It prioritizes performance and is optimized for even complex applications with many elements.

We have also shifted from prop-based APIs in NativeBase to compound APIs because that provides a more cohesive, robust and consistent interface for developers.

## Why use gluestack-ui v3/v2, when we already have gluestack-ui v1?

**gluestack-ui v3/v2** is a major upgrade from **v1**, designed to address the evolving needs of modern developers. With enhanced performance, improved developer experience, and greater flexibility, gluestack-ui v2 offers several advantages over its predecessor:

- **Modular Approach**: Avoid unnecessary bloat by selecting and using only the components you need.
- **Simple Integration**: Easily integrate components by copying and pasting code snippets directly into your project files.
- **Tailwind Class Support**: Enjoy seamless styling with Tailwind's intuitive utility classes with NativeWind.
- **RSC compatible components**: Optimize your applications with components that enhance performance by leveraging React Server Components.
- **Full Customization**: Tailor components to fit your project's needs by adjusting styles and behaviors.

## What will happen to existing gluestack-ui v1 users?

Existing **gluestack-ui v1** users will continue to have access to their current version, but we highly encourage upgrading to gluestack-ui v2 to take advantage of the new features and improvements. Here's what you can expect:

- **Continued Support**: We will provide maintenance and support for gluestack-ui v1 for a limited time to ensure a smooth transition.
- **Migration Guide**: We have prepared a comprehensive migration guide to help you seamlessly transition from v1 to v2. The guide includes detailed instructions, code examples, and best practices to ease the process. [Link to migration guide](/ui/docs/guides/more/upgrade-to-v2).
- **Enhanced Features**: By upgrading to v3/v2, you will benefit from improved performance, better developer experience, and more customization options.
- **Community and Documentation**: Extensive documentation and an active community will support you through the upgrade process and beyond.
- **Codemod Tool**: Additionally, we've developed a codemod tool to assist with the transition, streamlining the process and reducing manual effort. You can find instructions on how to install the codemod tool in our documentation [here](/ui/docs/home/overview/upgrade-to-v2).

We are committed to making the transition to gluestack-ui v2 as smooth and beneficial as possible for all our users.

## Future Considerations

gluestack-ui is committed to continuously expanding its library of components to meet the needs of developers. We plan to add more components to the library, such as date-time picker, bottom sheet, and more. Apart from that, we are actively working on improving the performance of the styling library using techniques such as bundler-plugins, tree flattening, and more.
