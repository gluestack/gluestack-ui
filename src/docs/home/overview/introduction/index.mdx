# Introduction

Customizable components and patterns for React, Next.js & React Native.

**gluestack-ui** offers customizable, beautifully designed components for your projects. Unlike traditional libraries, it's not a pre-packaged dependency. Choose the components you need and copy-paste them directly into your React, Next.js & React Native projects.

## gluestack-ui philosophy

### Why gluestack-ui exists
- **Problem:** Traditional UI libraries often force developers into rigid patterns, heavy dependencies, or platform-specific implementations.

- **Solution:** gluestack-ui promotes a universal, modular, and copy-paste approach that lets developers own their UI components completely.

- **Inspiration:** We started gluestack-ui v1 with a philosophy similar to React Aria & Radix UI, to keep the customization decoupled from component API and accessibility. By the time we announced v2, shadcn/ui had already taken over the web and today gluestack-ui and shadcn/ui are very similar, although gluestack-ui exists in the mobile and web world both!
### Goals & Non-Goals

#### Our goals

- **Universal Consistency:** One codebase, same behavior across React, Next.js, and React Native.

- **Developer Ownership:** Copy-paste components, modify freely, avoid vendor lock-in.

- **Performance & Accessibility:** Lightweight, optimized, and accessible components by default.

- **Community-Driven:** Open architecture encouraging contributions and experimentation.

#### Non-goals

**We don't aim to**
- Create another monolithic UI library with hundreds of pre-styled components
- Provide opinionated design themes that limit creative freedom
- Replace platform-specific optimizations with lowest-common-denominator solutions
- Build a proprietary styling system that requires learning new APIs
- Create dependencies that become bottlenecks for your project's evolution

### How gluestack-ui works

- **Source-to-Destination Architecture:** Maintain a single source of truth for components that automatically syncs across projects.

- **Copy-Paste Components:** Grab only what you need‚Äîno heavy dependencies required.

- **Theming & Tailwind Integration:** Flexible styling system that works for web & mobile.

- **TypeScript & RSC Ready:** Modern architecture for type safety and server-rendered apps.

### Design 101

- **Atomic, Composable Components:** Each component is small, reusable, and composable into more complex UIs.

- **Compound Components:** Components with sub-components (e.g., 
`<Button>`
`<ButtonText>`Click Me`</ButtonText>`
`</Button>`
), allowing more flexible layouts.

- **Accessibility by Default:** ARIA support baked in, keyboard navigable.

- **Minimal Runtime Overhead:** Lightweight runtime ensures high performance.

### Code 101

- **Copy-Paste Philosophy:** No ‚Äúmagical imports.‚Äù You copy the component directly into your codebase.

- **Fully Customizable:** You can override styles, props, and behavior easily.

- **Single Source of Truth:** All component logic lives in src/ for maintainability and easy updates.

- **Integration Ready:** Works out-of-the-box with Tailwind, NativeWind, and Next.js RSC.

This philosophy guides every decision in gluestack-ui's development, from API design to documentation structure, ensuring that developers have the tools they need to build exceptional user experiences without compromise.

## Future Considerations

gluestack-ui is committed to continuously expanding its library of components to meet the needs of developers. We plan to add more components to the library, such as date-time picker, bottom sheet, and more. Apart from that, we are actively working on improving the performance of the styling library using techniques such as bundler-plugins, tree flattening, and more.
