> Note: If snapPoints are not provided to Actionsheet, then it's essential to set maxHeight to ActionsheetContent.

#### ActionsheetBackdrop

It is React Native's [Pressable](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable) component, created using [@legendapp/motion's](https://legendapp.com/open-source/motion/) `createMotionAnimatedComponent` function to add animation to the component. You can use any declarative animation library you prefer.

#### ActionsheetContent

It inherits all the properties of [@legendapp/motion's](https://legendapp.com/open-source/motion/) [Motion.View](https://legendapp.com/open-source/motion/overview/) component. With this Actionsheet component, you have the flexibility to use any declarative animation library that suits your needs.

#### ActionsheetDragIndicatorWrapper

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) component.

#### ActionsheetDragIndicator

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) component.

#### ActionsheetItem

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [Pressable](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable) component.

#### ActionsheetItemText

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component.

#### ActionsheetIcon

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [View](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view) component.

#### ActionsheetScrollView

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [ScrollView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview) component.

#### ActionsheetVirtualizedList

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [VirtualizedList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/virtualizedlist) component.

#### ActionsheetSectionHeaderText

It inherits all the properties of React Native's [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) component.

> Note: While our Actionsheet component supports both ActionsheetScrollView and ActionsheetVirtualizedList, we recommend using VirtualizedList for better performance on large lists of items. The ScrollView option may cause performance issues on lists with many items.

### Features

- Actionsheet has aria-modal set to true.
- Actionsheet has role set to dialog.
- When the Actionsheet opens, focus is trapped within it.
- Pressing Esc closes the Actionsheet
- Clicking on the overlay closes the Actionsheet
- Scrolling is blocked on the elements behind the Actionsheet

### Accessibility

We have outlined the various features that ensure the Actionsheet component is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. These features help ensure that your application is inclusive and meets accessibility standards.

#### Keyboard

- `Tab + Enter`: Triggers the actionsheet action.

### Screen Reader

- VoiceOver: When the ActionSheet is focused, the screen reader will announce the button name. After entering the ActionSheet, it will read the content of the ActionSheet items.

#### Keyboard

- `Space`: Opens the actionsheet.
- `Enter`: Opens/closes the actionsheet.
- `Tab`: Moves focus to the next focusable element.
- `Shift + Tab`: Moves focus to the previous focusable element.
- `Esc`: Closes the actionsheet.

### Examples

The Examples section provides visual representations of the different variants of the component, allowing you to quickly and easily determine which one best fits your needs. Simply copy the code and integrate it into your project.

#### Keyboard handling

Demonstrates a common UI pattern known as keyboard handling or keyboard scrolling, in which an input field is automatically scrolled into view when the user taps on it and the keyboard appears. This improves usability and ensures that the input field is always visible and accessible, even when the keyboard is blocking part of the screen.

/// {Example:with-snappoints} ///

### Selection with State Persistence

This example demonstrates proper state handling when closing the actionsheet via drag gesture. Users can select a notification preference, and the selection is correctly saved whether they close by dragging or clicking the backdrop.

/// {Example:icons} ///

/// {Example:virtualized-list} ///

/// {Example:flatlist} ///

/// {Example:section-list} ///
