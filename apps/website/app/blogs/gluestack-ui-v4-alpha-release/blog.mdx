We're incredibly excited to announce **gluestack-ui v4 alpha** — a transformative evolution of our universal component library that brings modern design patterns, powerful animations, and an exceptional developer experience to React Native and Next.js applications.

After months of development, community feedback, and careful testing, v4 represents our vision for the future of universal component libraries. This release introduces significant improvements across design, performance, and developer experience while maintaining the copy-paste philosophy you love.

</Text>

## The Journey to v4

When we started planning v4, we asked ourselves a fundamental question: *"What would make gluestack-ui the best choice for modern app development in 2026?"*

The answer came from listening to our community — designers, developers, and teams who depend on gluestack-ui daily:

- **Designers** wanted a familiar, modern design language that doesn't require starting from scratch
- **Developers** wanted better performance and smoother animations that feel native
- **Teams** wanted easier theming and customization without complexity

v4 delivers on all three fronts while introducing groundbreaking features that set a new standard for universal component libraries.

## 🎨 shadcn-Inspired Design System

We've completely redesigned our entire component library to align with **shadcn/ui** — one of the most popular and beloved design systems in modern web development.

### Why shadcn?

**Familiar Design Language**

If you've worked with shadcn/ui on the web, you'll feel right at home with gluestack-ui v4. The visual language, component patterns, and design principles are consistent across platforms.

**Modern Aesthetic**

Clean, minimal, and professional out of the box. Our components look great without any customization, yet they're incredibly easy to adapt to your brand.

**Community Alignment**

By aligning with a design system that millions of developers already know and love, we're making it easier for teams to move between web and mobile development.

**Easy Customization**

Well-thought-out defaults that are simple to override. Every component has been designed with customization in mind.

### What's Changed

All **40+ components** have been completely redesigned:

- Refined spacing and typography for better visual hierarchy
- Improved contrast ratios for enhanced accessibility
- Consistent component variants (default, outline, ghost, link, etc.)
- Better focus states and interactive feedback
- Harmonized color usage across all components

## 🌈 Semantic Color System

One of the most significant changes in v4 is our new semantic color token system. Moving away from numeric color scales to meaningful, purpose-driven names.

### The New Color Architecture

```javascript
{
  // Semantic base colors
  background: 'rgb(var(--background))',
  foreground: 'rgb(var(--foreground))',

  // Component-specific colors
  primary: 'rgb(var(--primary))',
  secondary: 'rgb(var(--secondary))',
  accent: 'rgb(var(--accent))',
  muted: 'rgb(var(--muted))',

  // State colors
  destructive: 'rgb(var(--destructive))',

  // UI element colors
  border: 'rgb(var(--border))',
  input: 'rgb(var(--input))',
  ring: 'rgb(var(--ring))',
}
```

### Why Semantic Colors?

**Intuitive Naming**

Colors describe their purpose, not their appearance. `primary` is clearer than `blue500`.

**Effortless Theming**

Change your entire app's look by updating a few CSS variables. No need to search through components.

**Dark Mode Made Simple**

Perfect light/dark mode support with a single theme toggle. All color transitions are handled automatically.

**Type-Safe**

Full TypeScript support ensures you never use a color token that doesn't exist.

## ⚡ Modern Animation Engine

v4 introduces a powerful new animation foundation built on **react-native-reanimated** (~4.2.1), bringing native-quality animations to your applications.

### Why react-native-reanimated?

**Native Performance**

- Animations run on the UI thread, not the JavaScript thread
- Guaranteed 60 FPS even under heavy JavaScript load
- Smooth animations that feel native to each platform
- Better battery efficiency

**Ecosystem Excellence**

- Official recommendation from Expo and React Native teams
- Actively maintained and continuously improved
- Largest community support in the React Native ecosystem
- Future-proof for upcoming React Native features

**Developer Experience**

- Declarative animation API
- Worklets for complex gesture handling
- Excellent debugging tools
- TypeScript support built-in

### Components Powered by Reanimated

These components now deliver silky-smooth animations:

- **Accordion** - Smooth expand/collapse
- **Drawer** - Native-feeling slides
- **Modal** - Graceful entrance/exit
- **Menu** - Fluid open/close
- **Popover** - Delightful transitions
- **Toast** - Elegant notifications
- **And more...**

Some components still use `@legendapp/motion` for optimal performance in specific use cases. We'll continue optimizing based on community feedback.

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

v4 delivers measurable performance gains across the board:

| Metric | v3 | v4 | Improvement |
|--------|----|----|-------------|
| Initial Render (40 components) | 312ms | 198ms | **37% faster** |
| Animation Smoothness | 52 FPS | 60 FPS | **15% improvement** |
| Bundle Size (core + utils) | 156KB | 142KB | **9% smaller** |
| Memory Usage (sustained) | 28.4 MB | 24.1 MB | **15% reduction** |

*Benchmarks performed on iPhone 14 / Pixel 7 with production builds*

These aren't just numbers — you'll feel the difference in real-world applications, especially on mid-range and lower-end devices.

## 🛠️ Enhanced Developer Experience

### One-Command Upgrade

Migrating from v3 to v4 is incredibly straightforward:

```bash
npx gluestack-ui@alpha upgrade
```

The CLI automatically:
- Detects your current version
- Installs all required dependencies
- Updates configuration files
- Handles platform-specific setup
- Guides you through manual steps

### Import Compatibility

Great news! **v3 and v4 use identical import patterns**. Your existing imports work without changes:

```typescript
// These imports work in both v3 and v4!
import { createButton } from '@gluestack-ui/core/button/creator';
import { createCard } from '@gluestack-ui/core/card/creator';
import { tva } from '@gluestack-ui/utils/nativewind-utils';
```
