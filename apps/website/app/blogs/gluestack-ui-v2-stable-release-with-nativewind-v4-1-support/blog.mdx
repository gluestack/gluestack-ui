After months of hard work, countless iterations, and testing across platforms, we are thrilled to announce the **stable release of gluestack-ui v2**! This marks a significant milestone in our journey to empower developers with a seamless and efficient UI development experience.

With gluestack-ui v2, we’ve made some groundbreaking changes, eliminated unnecessary complexity, and aligned closely with the latest in React Native and Tailwind ecosystems.

Here’s what you can look forward to in this release:

## ✨ What’s New in gluestack-ui v2

### **90% Reduction in CSS File Size**

We’ve optimized the library to dramatically reduce the CSS footprint, ensuring faster load times and smoother performance, especially for large-scale projects.

### **600+ Lines of Code and Wrappers Removed**

We’ve significantly reduced boilerplate code, making gluestack-ui leaner and cleaner. This also means easier debugging and better maintainability for your projects.

### **Support for Data Attributes Without HOCs**

Previously, using data attributes required wrapping components with higher-order components (HOCs). Now, data attributes are supported natively, simplifying how you work with state-driven styles and interactions.

### **Compatible with NativeWind v4.1**

gluestack-ui is now fully aligned with the **latest NativeWind v4.1** release, bringing the best of Tailwind CSS to React Native. Expect enhanced features, better performance, and seamless integration.

### **Expo RSC (React Server Components) Compatibility**

gluestack-ui components are now compatible with **Expo React Server Components (RSC)**. This ensures optimal server-side rendering performance and smoother hydration on the client side, making your applications even more responsive.

### **Improved TypeScript Support**

We’ve significantly improved TypeScript support, ensuring better type definitions, autocomplete, and developer experience. Type errors are easier to spot, making your workflows smoother and more efficient.

## 🎉 **Why This Matters**

gluestack-ui v2 is built to make your life easier as a developer. Whether you’re building universal apps or optimizing for performance, this release addresses critical pain points and sets a new standard for React Native UI libraries.

By aligning with the latest standards and reducing complexity, we aim to provide a fast, flexible, and future-proof foundation.
