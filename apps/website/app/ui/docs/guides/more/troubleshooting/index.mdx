# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using nativewind, please refer to the nativewind [troubleshooting guide](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/guides/troubleshooting).

## Common Issues

### 1. "dark:" Variant Not Working as Expected

If you are using `dark:` and experiencing unexpected behavior, ensure that you have followed the documentation for [dark mode configuration](/home/theme-configuration/dark-mode) correctly.

### 2. Toast Inside Modal Not Functioning

When using `Toast` inside a `Modal`, ensure that you have added the `OverlayProvider` from `@gluestack-ui/overlay` to the root of your application.

```jsx
import { OverlayProvider } from '@gluestack-ui/overlay';
import { GluestackUIProvider } from '@/components/ui/gluestack-ui-provider';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <GluestackUIProvider>
      <OverlayProvider>
        <YourApp />
      </OverlayProvider>
    </GluestackUIProvider>
  );
};
```

### 3. Flashing Issue in Next.js

If encountering flashing issues in Next.js:

- Refer to the [installation documentation](https://gluestack.io/ui/nativewind/docs/home/getting-started/installation), click on manual, and ensure that step 4 is correctly configured.

### 4. TailwindCSS Classnames Not Overriding in react-native-web

To ensure Tailwind styles override with higher specificity, add `important: 'html'` to your `tailwind.config.js`.

```jsx
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  important: 'html',
  ...
}
```

## Known Issues

- `placeholder` does not work with CSS tokens.
- `dark:` does not function with "class" as a strategy in native devices.
