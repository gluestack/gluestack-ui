# @gluestack-ui/core

[@gluestack-ui/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gluestack-ui/core) provides a collection of utility functions for seamless integration of gluestack-ui and nativewind.

### tva (Tailwind Variant Authority)

The `tva` function serves as a wrapper around [Tailwind Variant](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/), extending its functionality.

In addition to the default Tailwind variant, it introduces support for `parentVariant` and `parentCompoundVariant`.

### VariantProps Utility

The `VariantProps` utility allows for easy extraction of variants from a component.

### flush

This function facilitates server-side rendering (SSR) by flushing out any styles generated during the process. This ensures that these styles are properly added to the HTML document.

### withStates

`withStates` is a Higher Order Component (HOC) designed to incorporate state-based styling into gluestack-ui components on native devices.

### withStyleContext

`withStyleContext` is a HOC that creates a React context with a defined scope.

### withStyleContextAndStates

This single HOC combines the functionality of both `withStyleContext` and `withStates`.

### useStyleContext

`useStyleContext` is a hook used to consume the context created by `withStyleContext` and `withStyleContextAndStates`.
