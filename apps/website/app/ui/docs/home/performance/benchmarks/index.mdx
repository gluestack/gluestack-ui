# Performance Benchmarks

`gluestack-ui` harnesses the power of [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/overview), a universal and highly performant styling library, to style the components.

# React Native

We performed the [benchmarks](https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui-benchmarks) with `React Native`, `gluestack-ui v1` and `gluestack-ui v2`.

**In each case we have rendered 1000 components with styling of each library. Results are average of 5 mounts.**

> **All the benchmarks were measured in production environment on iPhone 15.**

## Simple Component

The time it takes to render a simple themed component. We've developed a Box component using View with some default styles.

<ProgressGraph
  data={{
    'React Native': 68,
    'gluestack-ui v1': 132,
    'gluestack-ui v2': 99,
  }}
/>

## Component with variants

The time needed to render a component with different variations. We've developed a Box component using View with default styles and multiple variants.

<ProgressGraph
  data={{
    'React Native': 73,
    'gluestack-ui v1': 146,
    'gluestack-ui v2': 144,
  }}
/>

> Styled Components doesn't have built-in support for variants. We've incorporated prop-based variants into Styled Components.

## Component with default theme and inline styles

A component with default themes, variations, inline styles, and state styles. We've designed a Button component using Pressable with default style, variations, state style, and inline styles.

<ProgressGraph
  data={{
    'gluestack-ui v1': 360,
    'gluestack-ui v2': 241,
  }}
/>

> React Native doesn't provide out of the box support for state styling.

## Layout using HStack, VStack, Image and Text

Creating a layout with HStack, VStack, Image, and Text to display a list of 28 items. We've utilized components from the following libraries for this purpose.

<ProgressGraph
  data={{
    'React Native': 58,
    'gluestack-ui v1': 89,
    'gluestack-ui v2': 76,
  }}
/>

> Note: This test was taken from Tamagui.

# Web

We are working on dedicated benchmarks for the web. Stay tuned for more updates!

In the meantime, we have built the landing page for v2 using gluestack-ui v2. You can check out the lighthouse score below:
